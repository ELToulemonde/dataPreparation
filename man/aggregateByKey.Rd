\title{Automatic dataSet aggregation by key}
\usage{
aggregateByKey(dataSet, key, verbose = TRUE, thresh = 53, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataSet}{Matrix, data.frame or data.table (with only numeric, integer, factor, logical, character columns).}

\item{key}{The name of a column of dataSet according to which the set should be aggregated (character)}

\item{verbose}{Should the algorithm talk? (logical, default to TRUE)}

\item{thresh}{number of max values for frequencie count (numerical, default to 53)}

\item{...}{optional argument: \code{functions}:  aggregation functions for numeric columns (list of functions)
(vector of function, optional, if not set we use: c(mean, min, max, sd))}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{data.table}} with one line per \code{key} elements and mulitple new columns.
}
\description{
Automatic aggregation of a dataSet set according to a \code{key}\cr
}
\details{
Perform aggregation depending on column type:\cr
\itemize{
\item If column is numeric \code{functions} are performed on the column. So 1 numeric column 
give length(functions) new columns
\item If column is character or factor and have less than \code{thresh} different values, 
frequencie count of values is performed
\item If column is character or factor with more than \code{thresh} different values, number 
of different values for each \code{key} is performed
\item If columbn is logical, count of number and rate of positive is performed.
}
Be carefull using functions agrument, the function given should be an aggregation fuction, 
meaning that for multiple values it should only return one value.
}
\examples{
# Get generic dataset from R
data("adult")

# Aggregate it using aggregateByKey, in order to extract characteristics for each country
adult_aggregated <- aggregateByKey(adult, key = 'country')

# Exmple with other functions
power <- function(x){sum(x^2)}
adult_aggregated <- aggregateByKey(adult, key = 'country', functions = c(power, sqrt))

# sqrt is not an aggregation function, so it wasn't used.
